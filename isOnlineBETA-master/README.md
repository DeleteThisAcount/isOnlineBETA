### What is isOnline?

* * *

isOnline is an extension that can be used to easily know if a Scratcher is Offline or Online. This extension has been developed to be used in accordance with [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu), a project by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT Media lab. Some features include:

1.  Finding if a user is offline or online, by either right clicking on their name or going to their profile.
2.  Friend Lists: Recieve a notification when a friend of yours gets online.
3.  On July 5, 2017 the discuss button was removed from the Scratch navigation bar. This removal was very controversial. Using isOnline, you can add it back by simply clicking a few buttons.
